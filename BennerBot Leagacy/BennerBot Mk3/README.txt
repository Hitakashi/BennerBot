Hello, my name is Jdbener and today i am going to give you a basic walkthrough of how to use my twitch/hitbox chatbot, BennerBot! Bennerbot has been designed differently than other chatbots, it is designed by streamers for streamers, it has been designed to manage both twitch and hitbox simoltaniously, it has also been writen in java so it can be used from anywhere! If you have any bug reports or feature requests feal free to email me: jdbener@gmail.com and will try my best to include your input.

There are 3 steps to runing BennerBot:
1) Configuration: in the config folder is a file called config.yml. Open this folder in notepad or whatever you use, and edit it to your liking it is well commented and you should have no problem figuring out what things do.

2) Jar: in the mainfolder there will a file, bennerbot.jar, this file will run the entire bot.

3) WebDisplay: in the main foler is a file called index.html, if you have bennerbot.jar and bennerbot-cleaner.jar runing you will be able to view the chat in this file

(Let me know by email if i should add anything else to this file)
